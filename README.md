# Library-Management-System
I prepared this project in the Python Bootcamp program, which was held in cooperation with Akbank and Global AI Hub.


1)  In this project, an interactive library system was designed. When logging into the system, the user is greeted by a menu with a welcome message.
2)  When the user wants to add a book to the list, the books.txt file is opened and the added book is saved in this file. When you want to delete a book from the library or list all books, the operations performed in the menu are also performed in this text file. To log out of the system, the user must press 4. The user is warned if the user clicks on numbers other than those in the menu.
